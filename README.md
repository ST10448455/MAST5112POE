https://github.com/ST10448455/MAST5112POE I did improvements on my POE by adding a new code and making sure that the app is running.I created this app using azure labs and android studio.. I developed this app to allow users to perform specific tasks on a mobile or either desktop device. I did a home screen that displays the average  price of the menu items broken down into the different courses. My application has 5 pages. The home screen displays average price and 4 buttons linking to the other pages. When you click on the Manage Menu button it will display a menu page where a user can add and remove items on the menu, then there is a back button arrow that you can click then it will take you bac to the home page. There is a View starters button, when you click on it it display the guest menu with only the starters menu to see which starters are available then when you done viewing the starters menu you will click on the back arrow to return to the home screen. When you click on the View mains button it will display the main menu items, when you click on the back arrow it will take you back to the home screen. Then lastly you will click on the View desserts buttton, it will display the desserts menu. Those are the improvements l did on my application. Then after l tested it to see if itâ€™s working.
